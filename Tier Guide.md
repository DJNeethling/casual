To reach the second tier you must have 200k BASE stats(stats from items dont count)

To Gain stats you can go into this portal and choose any of the 4 locations inside.

Once inside you kill either Kirby or Finn to gain stats. Kirby will give you 30 stats while Finn gives 50. I reccomend killing Kirby until you are able to 1 shot Finn as it will give you more stats.

After you have reached 200k stats you must decide if you want to keep your base character model or choose a skin. The available skins for each class can be seen by looking in the top right corner of the map. For the second tier you will not be able to choose a skin yet, but if you wish to pick a skin later you will need to kill the golem for your class. If you decide to stay with the base model for your class you can kill the vampire. **Note: If you choose to go with skin your stats will be reset but you will start with +5k to your stats. If you stay with your normal model you will retain your stats.**

If you wish to stay the base model for your class kill this vampire until you recieve his drop

You will see all 6 classes with a circle infront of them. Walk into your classes circle with the tier material in inventory.


For your last tier you must now farm to 700k stats. After reaching 700k stats, if you have decided to go the skin route, you will have to farm boars for the skin you want. If you decided to not go with a skin you will have to kill the demon.
