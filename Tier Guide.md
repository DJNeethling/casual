To reach the second tier you must have 200k BASE stats(stats from items dont count)

To Gain stats you can go into this portal and choose any of the 4 locations inside.

Once inside you kill either Kirby or Finn to gain stats. Kirby will give you 30 stats while Finn gives 50. I reccomend killing Kirby until you are able to 1 shot Finn as it will give you more stats.

After you have reached 200k stats you must decide if you want to keep your base character model or choose a skin. The available skins for each class can see by looking in the top right corner of the map. For the second tier you will not be able to choose a skin yet, but if you wish to pick a skin later you will need to kill the golem for your class.
