## Casual RPG Item Guide

This item guide starts with items starting from the wraith boss that you spawn after hitting level 500.

I will refer to items as: Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item/Lifesteal item/ and lastly AOE item

From the first boss that looks like the Knight class obtain the Lifesteal item

From the boss that looks like the assassin obtain the lifesteal item.

From the wraith obtain one of each item.**(The wraith can be spawned by killing the red generators under the previous boss.)**

From the crab upgrade Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item once.**(Crab may be spawned by killing the generators under the wraith generators.**

After upgrading from the crab go back to the skeleton and pudge area and obtain one of the runes that drops from the pudges. Purify the rune as you did when you tiered. Pick the rune back up and go back into the circle to upgrade your Atk Speed item.

The Next boss is the Frost Dragons. To spawn them you must collect the items that are dropped by Kobolds and Lizards in the area you level up in. If you drop one of each on the shrine in the area where the Zombie/Void/Fel hound are a single frost dragon will spawn. I reccomend collecting a good amount of both of the material to spawn the dragon and then camping the dragon for a while.

Kill Frost Dragons and upgrade Atk item/Def item/HP item 20 times each.

Kill the Grim reaper until you get a new Lifesteal item. The item drops directly from him.
