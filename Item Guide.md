The Next boss is the Frost Dragons. To spawn them you must collect the items that are dropped by Kobolds and Lizards in the area you level up in. If you drop one of each on the shrine in the area where the Zombie/Void/Fel hound are a single frost dragon will spawn. I reccomend collecting a good amount of both of the material to spawn the dragon and then camping the dragon for a while.

The next 6 area's bosses will drop their upgrade materials and somewhere nearby they will also sometimes drop spawners where if you use it around 6-8 mini's will spawn. I dont reccomend spawning more than 1 batch of them at once otherwise you will have problems because you must kill each once twice within 30 seconds or so.

Go to 1-1 and kill this boss and upgrade your HP item once. Upgrade your Atk item 10 times. Upgrade your Def Item 20 times.

Go to 1-2 and upgrade your weapon 20 times
