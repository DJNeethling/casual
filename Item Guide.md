## Casual RPG Item Guide

This item guide starts with items starting from the wraith boss that you spawn after hitting level 500.

I will refer to items as: Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item/Lifesteal item/ and lastly AOE item

From the first boss that looks like the Knight class obtain the Lifesteal item

From the boss that looks like the assassin obtain the lifesteal item.

From the wraith obtain one of each item.(The wraith can be spawned by killing the red generators under the previous boss.)

From the crab upgrade Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item once.(Crab may be spawned by killing the generators under the wraith generators.
